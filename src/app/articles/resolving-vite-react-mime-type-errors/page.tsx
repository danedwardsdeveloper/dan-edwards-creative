				You're not alone if you encounter MIME type errors while working

				easily solved. In this article, I'll explore common MIME type errors
				in React applications and provide practical solutions.

			<Heading2>Common MIME Type Errors in React</Heading2>

			<Paragraph>
				Two frequent MIME type errors you might encounter are:
			</Paragraph>

			<CodeBlock
				fileName="Browser console"
				language="plaintext"
				disableLineNumbers
			>
				{`Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "application/octet-stream". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec. main.jsx:1

Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec. app.tsx:1`}
			</CodeBlock>

			<Heading2>First, check your build/ dist files</Heading2>

			<Paragraph>
				A typical build for a simple React site should result in optimized,
				production-ready files. After running the build process, you'll
				generally find a <InlineCode>dist</InlineCode> or{' '}
				<InlineCode>build</InlineCode> directory containing these files.
				Whether you've used TypeScript, Tailwind, Less, or other libraries
				and packages, the output should boil down to three main files: an
				index.html (the entry point), a CSS file, and a plain JavaScript
				file. However, you could have more files, depending on your bundler
				and the complexity of your project.
			</Paragraph>

			<Paragraph>
				The main CSS and JavaScript files will be minified (read: a chaotic
				hell of baffling code), and the filename will contain an 8-character
				hash, which ensures that browsers won't try to use old cached
				versions of your styles and scripts. Here's the build structure for
				a typical small project.
			</Paragraph>

			<CodeBlock
				fileName="Vite React project structure"
				language="plaintext"
				disableLineNumbers
			>
				{`dist/
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index-ABCD1234_.css
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index-DdzUmU42.js
â”œâ”€â”€ image.webp
â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.svg
â””â”€â”€ index.html`}

				Solution: Remove .JSX extensions from source code import statements
			</Heading2>

			<Paragraph>
				The most common cause of these errors is really annoyingly simple,
				which is what motivated me to write this article.
			</Paragraph>

			<CodeBlock
				fileName="Console error"
				language="plaintext"
				disableLineNumbers
			>
				{`index-fWGo7SiS.js:1 Failed to load module`}
			</CodeBlock>

			<Paragraph background="green">
				If you encounter a MIME type error in the console referencing a
				specific file, e.g., <InlineCode>App.tsx:1</InlineCode>, search your
				entire codebase for instances where you (or your IDE) might have
				unintentionally added the <InlineCode>.tsx</InlineCode>,{' '}
				<InlineCode>.tsx</InlineCode>, or <InlineCode>.ts</InlineCode>
				extensions to your imports.
			</Paragraph>

			<Paragraph>
				In Visual Studio Code, use <InlineCode>Shift Command F</InlineCode>{' '}
				on a Mac, or <InlineCode>Shift Ctrl F</InlineCode> on Windows to
				perform a project-wide search.
			</Paragraph>

			<Paragraph>
				I love using Vite - it's fantastic and well-maintained (
				<InlineCode>create-react-app</InlineCode> was depreciated on June
				23, 2023). Still, these errors could be avoided altogether if import
				file extensions were enforced. Other frameworks like Next.js do
				enforce this using ESLint.
			</Paragraph>

			<Heading2>File Extensions in React: Best Practices</Heading2>

			<Paragraph>Here's an example demonstrating best practices:</Paragraph>

			<CodeBlock fileName="MyComponent.tsx" language="tsx">
				{`// âœ…
import React from 'react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent'; // No extension
import { helperFunction } from './utils'; // No extension

// ðŸš«
import BadComponent from './BadComponent.jsx'; // Don't include .jsx
import { badHelper } from './badUtils.ts'; // Don't include .ts or .tsx

// âœ… Include the extension for CSS modules
import styles from './styles.module.css';

// âœ… Include the extension for non-JavaScript/TypeScript assets
import logo from './logo.svg';
import data from './data.json';

export default function App() {
    // Your component logic here
}`}
			</CodeBlock>

			<Paragraph>
				By understanding these common issues and following best practices
				for file extensions, you can avoid MIME type errors in your React
				applications.
